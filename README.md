# TodoApp_MERN
Thie is my first time in Node.JS .. the first ever project in MERN. built it focusing more on backend part and less on frontend/designing

#How to use
Download the "Todo-MERN" foler -> open it in your code editor -> open terminal for "frontend" and "backend" files -> type "npm install" command to get the node modulefolder.

#Database
MongoDB must me present in your system, start and connect the mongodb server.

#Execute
type "npm start" command in the frontend terminal, and "nodemon server" command in backend terminal.
